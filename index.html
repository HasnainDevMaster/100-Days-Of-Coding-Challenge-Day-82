<!-- Updating UI with Javascript -->

<!-- An Example of an Imperative Programming: -->

<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
    const app = document.getElementById('app');
    // Create a new H1 element
    const header = document.createElement('h1');
    // Create a new text node for the H1 element
    const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
    const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
    // Append the text node to the H1 element
    header.appendChild(headerContent);
    // Place the H1 element inside the div
    app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

1. Updating UI with JavaScript

This concept focuses on how JavaScript interacts with the HTML elements on a webpage to dynamically update the user interface (UI).
Instead of reloading the page to reflect changes, JavaScript can be used to update content, modify styles, and handle user input in real time.
Common JavaScript methods used for updating the UI include:

    * document.getElementById(), document.querySelector() to select elements.
    * element.innerHTML, element.textContent to change the content of elements.
    * Adding or removing classes to update styles (element.classList.add(), element.classList.remove()).

JavaScript plays a crucial role in making web pages interactive and responsive to user actions, improving the overall user experience.


2. HTML vs. the DOM

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of a webpage.
It defines elements like paragraphs, headings, links, and buttons. However, when a webpage is loaded in the browser,
the HTML is parsed and transformed into the DOM (Document Object Model), which represents the structure of the page in a tree-like format.
Each HTML element becomes a node in the DOM, and JavaScript can interact with this DOM to manipulate the webpage.

While HTML is static, the DOM is dynamic, allowing JavaScript to access, modify, or remove elements in real time.
This distinction enables the seamless updating of the UI without refreshing the page.


3. Imperative vs. Declarative Programming
    
    * Imperative Programming: This approach involves giving step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a specific result.
    In terms of UI updates, this would mean telling the computer exactly how to update the DOM, node by node.
    For example, using vanilla JavaScript to directly manipulate DOM elements is imperative programming.

    * Declarative Programming: Instead of detailing the steps to reach a result, you describe what the UI should look like in its final state.
    The underlying framework or library (like React) handles how to achieve that result. React,
    for example, focuses on "what" you want the UI to be, and React takes care of "how" to update the DOM efficiently.


4. React: A Declarative UI Library

React is a JavaScript library built around the declarative programming paradigm.
With React, instead of directly manipulating the DOM (as in imperative programming),
you declare what the UI should look like at any given point in time by defining components.
React automatically updates the DOM when data changes, ensuring the UI remains in sync with the application state.

Reactâ€™s key features include:

    * Components: Reusable pieces of UI that can accept data (props) and manage their own state.
    * Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efficiently calculate and apply updates to the real DOM, minimizing re-renders and improving performance.
By focusing on "what" the UI should be, developers can write cleaner, more maintainable code while React handles the complexity of updating the DOM efficiently. -->
